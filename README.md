# Arduino_Quadcopter
------------------------------------My Arduino Quadcopter Project-------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to create an auto-leveling quadcopter with an Arduino flight controller and a simple 3-axis Gyro.
Here are the components I use:                                                                                                 
Flight Controller - Arduino UNO                                                                                               
IMU - MPU 6050 3-axis Gyro + Accelerometer                                                                                   
Motors - 1000KV Brushless Motor + 1045 Propeller DJI F450                                                                    
Frame - DJI FLame Wheel F450 Frame (Anything similar should work)                                                             
Transmitter & Receiver - Flysky FS-T6 6-CH TX Transmitter and included receiver                                               
Battery - 11.1V 2200mAh 30C Li-polymer Battery                                                                                
                                                                                                                              
This will contain mostly Arduino code for controlling a quadcopter but also other programs I have written such as simulations.
